2.1 Invoking cfdisk
===================

cfdisk [options] [device]


File: cfdisk.info,  Node: Overview,  Next: Options,  Prev: Invoking cfdisk,  Up: Using cfdisk

2.2 Overview
============

Hard disks can be divided into logical disks called partitions (or disk
slices in the BSD world), which are described in a partition table,
which is also called a disklabel.

   For ordinary use, like file storage or operation system
installation, you will most likely need at least one partition,
although with most modern operating system, you might also want to
create several partitions, including one for swap space. For example,
you usually create a seperate partition for home directories. For more
information on what partitions you need for your operating system, look
at its installation manual.

   GNU cfdisk is a menu-driven program for creating and editing
partition tables. It has support for DOS and MAC type partition tables,
BSD and SUN type disklabels and others.

   If you don't specify the device of the disk, cfdisk tries to look
for devices and opens the first device available. On most GNU/Linux
distributions device is usually one of the following:

          /dev/hda /dev/hdb /dev/sda /dev/sdb


   IDE disks are usually using /dev/hd[a-h] for device names, SCSI
disks - /dev/sd[a-p]. The partitions will take the device name followed
by the partition number, e.g. /dev/hda1. If you are using a GNU/Linux
operating system, you can see /usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt
for more infomation on device naming.

   A DOS type partition table can have up to four `primary' partitions,
which get numbers 1-4. One of the primary partitions may be used as an
`extended' partition, which is used as a container for more partitions,
which are called `logical' and take numbers starting from 5.

   A BSD/SUN type disklabel can hold up to 8 partitions, and an
IRIX/SGI type disk label, called `dvh' in cfdisk can hold up to 16.

2.3 Options
===========

`-h, --help'
     Displays a help message.

`-v, --version'
     Displays the program's version.

`-a, --arrow-cursor'
     Use an arrow cursor, instead of reverse video highlighting, in
     case your terminal doesn't support it.

`-z, --new-table'
     Create a new partition table on the disk. This is useful if  you
     want  to  change the partition table type or want to repartition
     you entire drive. Note that this does not delete the  old  table
     on the disk until you commit the changes.

`-u, --units=UNIT'
     Sets the default display units to UNIT. A list of possible units
     is given below.

`-t, --list-partition-types'
     Displays a list of supported partition types and features.



File: cfdisk.info,  Node: Units,  Next: Usage,  Prev: Options,  Up: Using cfdisk

2.4 Units
=========

You can choose in what unit cfdisk should display quantities like
partition sizes. You can choose from sectors, percents, bytes,
kilobytes, etc. Note that one kilobyte is equal to 1,000 bytes, as this
is consistent with the SI prefixes and is used by hard disk
manufacturers. If you prefer to see the sizes in units with binary
prefixes, you should instead select one kilo binary byte (kibibyte),
which is equal to 1,024 bytes. Whatever display unit you have chosen,
you can always enter the quantities in the unit of your choice, for
example 1000000B or 1000kB.

`compact'
     Display each size in the most suitable unit from B, kB, MB, GB and
     TB.

`B'
     One byte

`kB '
     One kilobyte (1,000 bytes)

`MB'
     One megabyte (1,000,000 bytes)

`GB'
     One gigabyte (1,000,000,000 bytes)

`TB'
     One terabyte (1,000,000,000,000 bytes)

`KiB'
     One kilo binary byte (1,024 bytes)

`MiB'
     One mega binary byte (1,048,576 bytes)

`GiB'
     One giga binary byte (1,073,741,824 bytes)

`TiB'
     One tera binary byte (1,099,511,627,776 bytes)

`s'
     One sector. It depends on the sector size of the disk. You can use
     it if you want to see or choose the exact size in sectors.

`%'
     One percent from the size of the disk

`cyl'
     One cylinder. It depends on the cylinder size.

`chs'
     Use CHS display units.

2.5 Usage
=========

GNU cfdisk uses a simple menu driven interface, which attempts to be
clear and easy to use. It shows a list of the partitions, showing basic
information about them, such as number, size, type and filesystem. If
the partition contains no filesystem, on certain partition table types
the partition system type is displayed in brackets. You to navigate
through the partitions using the up and down arrow keys on your
keyboard. You can perform actions on the selected partition either by
pressing their shortcut key, or by navigating through the menu of
actions with the left and right arrow and launching it by pressing the
enter key. Other choice menus are also usable with both shortcut keys
and direct selection, and the Esc key is usually used to cancel the
choice. The actions are not performed immediately, but only after you
decide to commit the changes to the disk. Here is a list of the
possible actions and their shortcut keys.

`n'
     If you have selected a free space, creates a new partition
     residing on it. The possible types of the new partition, such as
     Primary, Extended and Logical are shown in the type column in the
     partition list. For example if the free space is part of the
     extended partition, its type will be displayed as Logical. If
     multiple types are possible, a choice menu will appear. You can
     select primary partition with the `p' key and extended partition
     with `e', or alternatively you can cancel the creation with `c'.
     You will be asked in which part of the free space you want to
     place the partition. You can place it in the beginning with `s',
     at the end with `e'. If you want to select a custom region and
     specify exact start and end of the partition, you should press
     `c'. You will then prompted about the size of the partition, the
     default choice creates a partition on the entire free space.
     Please note that you can enter the size in any of the units given
     above. If you don't specify a unit after the number, the default
     unit is used. At this point, you will be asked about the
     filesystem type. If you don't know what partition type suits you,
     check operating system documentation about supported filesystems,
     ext3 is usually a safe choice. The partition will be created at
     the close as possible to your choice and you will be warned if it
     is too small or too large for the filesystem you have selected.

`d'
     Delete the selected partition so you can use it to create another
     partition on the free space left by it.

`f'
     Creates a new file system on the selected partition. You will be
     asked to choose from a list of the filesystem types that are
     supported for creation. Please note that this requires that all
     changes you made so far are commited to the disk. If there is
     already a filesystem on the partition, it is destroyed.

`c'
     Checks the consistency of the filesystem.  It is useful to see
     whether it is safe to perform operations like resize on the
     partitions. It performs a very basic check on the filesystem, so
     if you want to make a more thorough test or fix the errors on the
     filesystem, you should an external utility like e2fsck for ext2 or
     reiserfsck for reiserfs. Please note that the check is limited on
     some filesystem types (ext2, ext3 and reiserfs at the time of
     writing of the manual), but if the partition contains errors
     resize will gracefully fail without destroying the filesystem.

`r'
     Resizes the partition without destroying the data on it, or just
     changes the partition size. The latter is useful if you want to
     resize the partition with external utilities or if you want to
     create a new filesystem on it. Don't use it if you don't know what
     you are doing. If resizing of the filesystem on the partition is
     supported you will be asked what to do. Pressing `r' resizes,
     while pressing `c' just changes the partition size. Then like when
     creating a new partition you will be asked to choose among the
     possible places and sizes to place the partition. The choices are
     between placing it at the beginning of the free space before it
     with `b', leaving its starting point fixed with `s' and placing it
     at end of the free space after it with `e'. You are adviced to
     check the partition before performing resize, and backup the data
     if possible. Resizing requires that all changes you made so far
     are commited to the disk.

`o'
     Moves the partition to another place on the hard disk. You will be
     asked to select on which free space to put the partition and then
     prompted for a position and size, in the same manner as when
     creating a new partition. The new place of the partition can't
     overlap with the old one. If this is what you need, you should try
     using the resize function, instead. Moving the partition requires
     that all changes you made so far are commited to the disk.

`y'
     Copies another partition over the selected one. This destroys all
     data on the current partition and requires all changes to be
     commited to the disk. You are not limited to select a partition
     only from the device you are currently editing. You will be asked
     about device and partition. You can't copy an extended partition.

`s'
     Run a filesystem rescue by looking for deleted partitions within a
     free space. It requires that everything is commited to the disk
     immediately. Looking for partitions over the existing partitions
     is not supported and doesn't seem much meaningful, but if you need
     it, you can try deleting the partitions. You can select the range
     where to look for partitions by pressing `c', or if you want to
     check the whole free space, you should press `g'.

`b'
     Shows a list of the flags allowing you to change them. You will
     most likely need this to make the partition bootable. It is not
     recommended to touch any flags other than the bootable flag. Do
     not do it, unless you know what they are for, and have in mind
     that changing certain flags is known not to work. You change the
     flag by pressing space or enter, and you leave the list with Esc.
     See the next section a description of all possible flags.

`t'
     Changes the system type on the partition. This does not convert
     the filesystem, it just changes the information stored in the
     partition. This is useful for cases where the system type on the
     partition doesn't match the filesystem type, for example you have
     an fat32 partition on an DOS type partition table, having an ext2
     filesystem on it. Changing the system type is not really
     meaningful on all partition table types. The default is to
     automatically determine the system type from the current
     filesystem with `a'. You can also select a custom filesystem by
     pressing `c', but this is not recommended. Direct choosing a
     specific system type is not supported.

`m'
     If the partition table type supports partition names, this allows
     you to change it. This is not working on all partition table
     types, as the partition names could be used for other purposes,
     like identifying the partition type or filesystem.

`x'
     If you have selected the extended partition, this makes it as big
     as possible, so you have more place for partitions inside it. It
     should expand the partition up to the beginning of the first
     partition after it.

`z'
     If you have selected the extended partition, this makes it as
     small as possible. You should need this, if you want to create
     more primary partitions after the logical partitions contained in
     the extended. If the extended partition contains no partitions,
     this deletes it.

`u'
     This allows you to select the display units. This changes the
     units used to display the sizes in the partition list and the
     default unit that is used on size prompts, though you are not
     limited to it when entering sizes. See the "Units" section for
     more information. The shortcuts are `b', `k', `m', `g', `t' for
     bytes, decimal kilobytes, megabytes, etc., `K', `M', `G' and `T'
     for the binary equivalents, `c' for percents, `a' to automatically
     choose the most suitable (`Compact'), `s' for sectors, `y' for
     cylinders, `C' for C/H/S values.

`i'
     Displays a short info about the partition, like its device (or at
     least what cfdisk believes that should be its device), the system
     type of the partition in the partition table (most useful if you
     are editing a DOS type partition table), the exact start and end
     of the partition.

`w'
     Writes the changes in the partition to the disk and notifies the
     operating system to reread it. Do this after you have completed
     editing your partition table. This might destroy data on your
     disk, if you have deleted partitions, and so on, so be careful. If
     the partition table is not re-read correctly by the operating
     system, you should reboot your computer.

`q'
     Quits the program. If you have made changes and you haven't
     commited them to the disk, they will be lost.

`h'
     Displays a short help. If you have reached this point, it is
     highly unlikely that you need it.

2.6 Flags
=========

`boot'
     (Mac, MS-DOS, PC98) - should be enabled if you want to boot off the
     partition.  The semantics vary between disk labels.  For MS-DOS
     disk labels, only one partition can be bootable.  If you are
     installing LILO on a partition that partition must be bootable.
     For PC98 disk labels, all ext2 partitions must be bootable (this is
     enforced by Parted).

`lba'
     (MS-DOS) - this flag can be enabled to tell MS DOS, MS Windows 9x
     and MS Windows ME based operating systems to use Linear (LBA) mode.

`root'
     (Mac) - this flag should be enabled if the partition is the root
     device to be used by Linux.

`swap'
     (Mac) - this flag should be enabled if the partition is the swap
     device to be used by Linux.

`hidden'
     (MS-DOS, PC98) - this flag can be enabled to hide partitions from
     Microsoft operating systems.

`raid'
     (MS-DOS) - this flag can be enabled to tell linux the partition is
     a software RAID partition.

`LVM'
     (MS-DOS) - this flag can be enabled to tell linux the partition is
     a physical volume.

`PALO'
     (MS-DOS) - this flag can be enabled so that the partition can be
     used by the Linux/PA-RISC boot loader, palo.

`PREP'
     (MS-DOS) - this flag can be enabled so that the partition can be
     used as a PReP boot partition on PowerPC PReP or IBM RS6K/CHRP
     hardware.

A.1 GNU Free Documentation License
==================================

                        Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has less than five).

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and
          add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications",
          preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all
          the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
          conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgments", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

A.1.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
